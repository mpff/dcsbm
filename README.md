# dcsbm

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dcsbm is to provide methods for estimating a two-way degree
corrected stochastic block model for directed, weighted graphs. Uses the
‘igraph’ library <https://igraph.org> for graph handling. See Peixoto
(2014) \<10.1103/PhysRevE.89.012804\> for details on the inference
algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mpff/dcsbm")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(dcsbm)
## basic example code
```
