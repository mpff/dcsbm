#' dcsbm: Estimate degree corrected stochastic block models
#'
#' The 'dcsbm' packages provides methods for estimating a two-way degree
#' corrected stochastic block model for directed, weighted graphs. Depends on
#' the 'igraph' library <https://igraph.org> for graph handling. See Peixoto
#' (2014) <10.1103/PhysRevE.89.012804> for details on the inference algorithm.
