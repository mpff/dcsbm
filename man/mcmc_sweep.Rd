\title{Run multiple MCMC sweep overs nodes}
\usage{
mcmc_sweep(G, p, B, dc = FALSE, n.sweeps = 1, eps = 0.1, beta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{An igraph graph.}

\item{p}{Vector of integer values giving the initial block membership
of each vertex}

\item{B}{Number of blocks.}

\item{n.sweeps}{Number of sweeps to run.}

\item{eps}{(optional) A number giving the ...}

\item{beta}{(optional) A number giving the greediness of the moves.}
}
\value{
A new partition given as a vector of integer values.
}
\description{
Runs a n.sweeps MCMC sweep across all nodes (for algorithm details see Piexoto,
2018). Each node is given a chance to move blocks or stay in current block
and all nodes are processed in random order for each sweep.
