\title{Run a single MCMC sweep over nodes}
\usage{
mcmc_single_sweep(G, p, B, dc = FALSE, eps = 0.1, beta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{An igraph graph.}

\item{p}{Vector of integer values giving the block membership of each
vertex}

\item{B}{Number of blocks.}

\item{dc}{Wether to use degree correction.}

\item{eps}{(optional) A number giving the ...}

\item{beta}{(optional) A number giving the greediness of the moves.}
}
\value{
A new partition given as a vector of integer values.
}
\description{
Runs a single MCMC sweep across all nodes (for algorithm details see Piexoto,
2018). Each node is given a chance to move blocks or stay in current block
and all nodes are processed in random order.
